Bylaws for the Numbayme Decentral Bank 

﻿
**Bylaws**

1. **Procedural Rules** 
   1. **Silver-Backed Certificates**
      1. The NDB's primary purpose and activity shall be to issue and redeem silver-backed certificates (SBC) of various denominations.
      1. The design, denominations, and security features shall be explained elsewhere in these bylaws, which may link to a “NDB Certificate Technical Sheet,”  to help users establish that their certificates are genuine, with additional private technical sheets to help NDB personnel create the certificates.
   4. **Board of Governors** 
      1. A board of 3 governors will maintain documents and ensure smooth operations.
      1. These governors will remain anonymous or eponymous to prevent unwanted intervention in bank operations, to meet our need for sovereignty and autonomy.
      1. The board of governors itself shall decide via majority vote to replace and appoint new governors as necessary.
   1. **Legal Compliance** 
      1. The NDB board of governors will carry out research to determine the feasibility of compliance with and consent to [ULEX Law](https://github.com/ulex-opensource/Ulex), especially sections 2.5.3 and 2.5.4.
      1. Further research will be done on this topic and the board of governors will move towards comprehension and compliance if it is determined to be a good path.
      1. If communities in the area decide to branch ULEX, the NDB will strongly consider declaring compliance with and consent to the branch.
   6. **Audits**
      1. An audit of physical silver holdings shall be done regularly by an independent community member.
      1. A Level 2 audit shall be done once per month

   7. **Public Announcements**
      1. The NDB will maintain a public channel on the Telegram app: https://t.me/numbaymedb

      1. Should these change for any reason, the surrounding community will be informed.
      1. The public channel will regularly announce equivalent fiat currency amounts for silver denominations on the certificates. This will make it easier to transact on a regular basis.
      1. The channel will also post the documents mentioned here, and announce any important changes.
      1. The email can be used for inquiries from holders of silver certificates and other interested parties.
   8. **Redemptions of Silver-backed Certificates (SBCs)**  
      1. When a certificate is redeemed, the holder will receive the full weight in silver, unless a fee is applicable and the holder chooses to have the fee deducted rather than paying it separately.
      1. Certain transactions may incur small fees to help cover DCB operational expenses. This will be detailed elsewhere in the bylaws.
      1. For ease of understanding fees, a separate document, titled “NDB Fee Schedule” will outline these policies in a reader-friendly way. This will be posted in the public channel.
      1. This fee schedule can be changed once in the first 6 month period after the official inception of the bank, once more in the 12 month period following, and after that can be changed only once every 2 years, and only with the unanimous approval of all members of the Board of Governors
   9. **Bank Assets**
      1. The bank may hold assets reasonable for its operation, such as a safe, stamps, administrative supplies, etc.
      1. The bank may receive a small loan to begin operations and from then on, it must earn revenue from transaction fees.
      1. The physical silver that the bank possesses, that is allocated as backing the issued certificates, will be recorded on its balance sheet as a liability
      1. The bank is obligated to return this allocated silver to certificate holders in case of a valid redemption request
   10. **Exchange with fiat**
       1. The Decentral Bank shall generally not engage in fiat currency transactions, with the primary exception being if it has silver on loan to be sold for fiat from a third party.
       1. If a client holds silver certificates and wishes to exchange them for USD, they can be exchanged with any willing third party for USD.
       1. If a client has silver and wishes to exchange with USD, the client can contact the Decentral Bank to see if there are any outstanding USD offers, otherwise the client can sell to any willing third party.
   11. **Additional Regulations**
       1. The board of governors may change the bylaws with a majority vote.
       1. Any changes to the bylaws must not defy the underlying sentiment behind the Decentral Bank charter document, nor may they contradict the charter.

   1. **Recordkeeping**
      1. Records must be clear and concise.
      1. Records must be redundantly stored.
      1. All digital records must be printed no less than once every 60 days (unless they were unchanged), with a hard copy kept in the silver vault.
   1. **Audit Processes**
      1. **Level 2 Audit (once per month)** A community member who is not on the board of governors shall be selected, preferably not the same each month, to count the silver held by the NDB, and compare it to the allocated holdings in the accounting records. Their results and declaration will be published on the public channel maintained by NDB. An unfavorable audit result may result in SBC holders redeeming their certificates and the SBCs falling out of favor.
      1. **Level 1 Audit (once per year)** This is a more detailed audit. It will consist of a Level 2 Audit, plus checking the written records against the computer record, the list of serial numbers in physical vs digital form, and the serial numbers of certificates stored out of circulation.
   1. **Transaction Fees**
      1. Redemption fee for small transactions: Any redemption smaller than 70 grams (approximately $49 USD at time-of-writing spot price) shall incur a small transaction fee of 10% of the value of the redemption. Redemptions larger than this amount shall incur no charge.
      1. Division of denominations: Individuals or businesses requesting large quantities of exchanges of large-denomination certificates into smaller-denomination certificates may be charged a printing and service fee. The NDB Board of Governors may decide the limit and fee when this becomes necessary, and this may be clarified in these bylaws at a future date.

      1. Small remainders, any amounts that cannot be redeemed or exchanged due to denomination issues, can be issued as an IOU to the client, who can be reimbursed once the appropriate amount of fiat or denomination of silver becomes available.

      1. Exchange of damaged certificates shall be carried out at no charge to the client. *See NDB Bylaws 2(vii)a.*
      1. Redemptions must be honored regardless of whether the holder of the certificate is the original person who deposited the silver, or a third party who has received the certificate via any means. When the certificate changes hands, the ownership of the silver changes hands.
      1. Silver selection for redemptions shall be carried out in favor of the bank, with sterling silver items being first, followed by 90% US coins and similar, followed by private mint rounds and bars, followed by government mint rounds and bars.
      1. Standard known weights and purities shall be used for redemptions, and a scale should be used to verify weights when necessary.  
      1. A reference table with information about Sterling silver and US silver coin purities and weights should be made available to the client during redemptions.
      1. The bank verifies silver source to the best of its ability, and silver is not faked nearly as often as gold. Despite this low risk, it is still solely the client’s responsibility to verify the authenticity of silver received.
